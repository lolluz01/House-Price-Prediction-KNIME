## 🌍 About the Project

Real estate valuation has traditionally relied heavily on subjective expertise, which often leads to pricing inconsistencies and high portfolio variance. 

This project details the development of a data-driven price estimation tool utilizing the [**King County House Sales (USA)** dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)  (21,613 observations, 21 features). The study pursues a dual objective:
1. Constructing a highly accurate predictive machine learning model.
2. Interpreting the primary determinants of market value to support real estate decision-making.

> **TL;DR:** The analysis successfully transitioned from a parametric Linear Regression baseline to advanced non-parametric gradient boosting architectures. By combining spatial feature engineering (K-Means) with an XGBoost Tree Ensemble, the final model broke the 0.90 $R^2$ threshold. The study proves that structural magnitude, construction quality, and precise location are the foundational pillars of property value in King County.


## 📊 Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. The Power of Spatial Feature Engineering
Standard spatial coordinates (latitude/longitude) hold no linear relationship with housing prices. We visualized the geographical distribution to assess the impact of location. The data confirms that high-value properties are spatially clustered, particularly in northern sectors and waterfront areas.

</div>

To provide the baseline linear model with a usable spatial structure, we engineered a K-Means clustering algorithm ($K=15$) to synthesize high-cardinality ZIP codes into homogeneous economic sub-markets. This custom geographic clustering proved to be an extremely significant predictor in the linear baseline.

### 2. Model Performance: XGBoost Surpasses the 0.90 Barrier
A comparative analysis was conducted between a parametric Linear Regression baseline and non-parametric ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost). 

The diagnostic evaluation of the linear baseline included an inspection of the Actual vs. Predicted scatter plot. The observed data points cluster tightly along the identity line, confirming the efficacy of the logarithmic transformation applied to the target variable.

</div>

However, quantitative results designate the **XGBoost algorithm (Full Feature setup) as the superior architecture**. XGBoost demonstrated superior noise robustness, effectively leveraging secondary contextual variables (like neighborhood sizing `sqft_living15`) to capture complex market dynamics that simpler models discarded as noise.

**Final Model Comparison Summary**:

| Model Architecture | Configuration | Test $R^2$ | Test MAE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | Baseline (Log-Target) | 0.826 | 0.315* |
| **Random Forest** | Optimized (10 Features) | 0.884 | $69,869 |
| **XGBoost** | **Full (No Feature Selection)** | **0.901** | **$66,316** |

*\*Note: Linear Regression MAE is reported in log-scale units.*

### 3. The Three Pillars of Real Estate Value
XGBoost models were analyzed using the Total Gain metric that quantifies the average reduction in prediction error contributed by a feature. Feature importance analysis reveals that real estate prices in King County are a non-linear function defined by three fundamental pillars:
* **Physical Magnitude:** Total square footage of the living area (`sqft_living`).
* **Construction Quality:** Represented by the overall structural grade (`grade`).
* **Precise Location:** Captured via spatial clusters or raw latitude/longitude (`lat` or `lon`).

## ⚙️ Methodology & Tech Stack

The analytical workflow was primarily implemented in **KNIME** to maintain a consistent low-code architecture. To bypass specific reporting limitations, **Python** scripting nodes were strategically integrated for advanced visualization and granular statistical diagnostics.

### Pipeline Highlights:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Logarithmic transformations of skewed variables (e.g., price, sqft_living) to satisfy the assumption of residual normality and homoscedasticity for the linear model.
* **Spatial Clustering:** Z-score normalization of coordinates followed by K-Means ($K=15$), validated via Silhouette analysis, Cohesion/Separation metrics, and the Dunn index.
* **Feature Selection:** Backward Feature Elimination strategy applied to optimize the balance between complexity and predictive accuracy.
* **Model Validation:** 10-Fold Cross-Validation confirmed the structural stability of the models.


## 🚀 Future Work

Despite the global model's robustness, the application of a uniform decision logic across a heterogeneous market remains a limitation. Future development should therefore focus on **Stratified Segmentation Modeling**, partitioning the dataset into distinct price tiers (e.g., Economy, Mid-Range, Luxury). Training specific sub-models for each tier allows for the capture of granular nuances, offering a pathway to further reduce residual variance in extreme market segments.
